# Make.com Workflow Structure (Initial Placeholder)

This document outlines the conceptual structure for the Make.com workflow.

## Trigger:
- **Incoming Call/Message:** (e.g., via Twilio webhook, or a Make.com specific trigger for voice/chat if available)

## Initial Actions:
1.  **Receive Input:** Get the raw input from the user (e.g., voice transcribed to text, or text message).
2.  **Basic Logging:** Log the incoming request details (timestamp, caller ID if available, input text).
3.  **Route to FAQ Handler (Placeholder):**
    - For now, this step will conceptually pass the input text to our `src/faq_handler.py`.
    - In a real Make.com scenario, this might involve:
        - An HTTP request to a service hosting the Python script.
        - Or, if Make.com supports direct Python execution, running the script.
4.  **Receive Output from FAQ Handler:** Get the response generated by `src/faq_handler.py`.
5.  **Return Response to User:** Send the response back to the user via the originating platform (e.g., synthesize text to speech and play back, or send as a text message).

## Future Enhancements (Not in this phase):
- NLP for intent recognition.
- Integration with CRM.
- Database lookups for dynamic information.
- Error handling and escalation.
